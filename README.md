# Saltmarshes 2017
Code used in manipulation and analysis of spatial data for UK saltmarshes.

Data files are not included; this code is intended to provide an overview of the methods used in the research.

Two files are available; the first (Saltmarsh Data) runs all data manipulation - calculating nearest land distances for wave fetch, distances across saltmarshes and mudflats, marsh and mudflat densities, density of zone type, distance across each zone, and extracting necessary data from other data sources. 

The second file (Saltmarsh Analysis) computes the analysis portion of this research. It includes code for designing the heat maps, exploratory figures, and the process of fitting the full models on subsets of data and storing and averaging them, followed by fitting the reduced models with only significant parameters using the same protocol. The code for the output graphs obtained from the regressions is also available.
